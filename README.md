Ad Campaign Performance Dashboard - Power BI Project
Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI project that analyzes the performance of a social media advertising campaign. The goal is to transform a raw dataset from an ad manager into a dynamic, interactive dashboard. This dashboard provides actionable insights for marketing teams to evaluate campaign effectiveness, understand audience engagement, and optimize future ad spend.

This project was completed as part of a data science task provided by Future Interns.

üìä Dashboard Preview
Here is a screenshot of the final dashboard. The live, interactive version can be viewed by opening the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop.

üéØ Key Questions Addressed
The dashboard was designed to answer critical business questions, including:

Overall Performance: How well did the ad campaign perform at a high level?

Key Metrics: What was the total Spend, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Return on Investment (ROI)?

Top Performers: Which specific posts or ads had the highest engagement?

Audience Insights: Which demographic segments (age, gender) were most responsive to the ads?

Actionable Recommendations: What data-driven improvements can be made for the next campaign?

‚ú® Dashboard Features
KPI Overview: At-a-glance cards for primary metrics like Total Spend, Clicks, Impressions, CTR, and ROI.

Top Performing Ads: A bar chart dynamically filtered to display the top 10 ads by click volume.

Demographic Analysis: Visual breakdowns of performance by different age groups and genders.

Interactive Slicers: User-friendly filters for Age, Gender, and Campaign ID that allow for deep-dive analysis into specific segments.

impressions: The number of times the ad was displayed.

clicks: The number of clicks on the ad.

spent: The amount spent on the ad (in the local currency).

approved_conversion: The number of successful conversions from the ad.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Power BI: Used for the entire workflow, including:

Power Query: For data cleaning, transformation, and ensuring correct data types.

Data Modeling: For creating relationships between data tables (if needed).

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom calculated measures for KPIs like CTR and ROI.

Power BI Desktop: For creating the dashboard visuals and user interface.
